# Ascolorii

A tiny generic colorscript strongly inspired by @roberoonska's [dotfiles](https://github.com/roberoonska/dotfiles).

## Demo

## How to use it

Get repository:

    git clone https://github.com/aloisdg/Ascolorii.git
	
Run the script with a path to a 6 columns (or less) ascii art file:

    ./ascolorii ascii/hello.txt

Enjoy!

## Create Ascii Art

I draw hello.txt by hand. I used [Block Elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_Elements) for a better result.
later, I will look to use a [generator](http://www.richard-h-clark.com/projects/block-art.html) made by @richard-clark.

If you made or found a good one I would love to add it to the repository. Feel free to open a Pull request for it!

## Caveas

I made this for fun after seeing this @roberoonska's [post](https://redd.it/42pgv7) on [/r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/).
I am an early bash user. This script mays contain a lot of mistake/error/whatever. If you find one, you can open an issue.
